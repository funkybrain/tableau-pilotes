Dev Notes:
---------
> DM associations can be tricky. Use belongs_to when you want to put a foreign key in a table
e.g. in Grade table -  'belongs_to :nation' will add an 'id_nation' f key in the Grade table. That's counter(my)intuition :/
> Table 1 has n Table 2 will create a Table1.id fk in Table 2
> Don't forget to plurialize one-to-many associations, e.g. has n, :grades and NOT grade
> datamapper tried to plurialize 'Sortie' as 'Sorty' and not 'Sorties', hence the clusterfuck.
